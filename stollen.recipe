KAF Stollen (with adaptations from Rosemary)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
[See notes at the end]

Fruit--Put together to soak:
    3 cups/1 pound "fruitcake blend"
    1/3 cup orange juice or rum

or [our variant]
    7 oz. "European Candied Mixed Peel" from KAF
    Currants bought from the IGA to make up three cups
    1/3 cup Goslings Black Seal rum

Knead together to form a smooth, soft dough:
    3.5 cups     AP flour
    1/4 cup      granulated sugar
    1 tsp        salt
    1/4 cup      Dry Milk
    8 Tbsp       softened unsalted butter

    1 TABLESPOON SAF instant yeast

    3/4 Cup      warm water
    1            large egg

    1/2 tsp ground mace (or nutmeg)
    1/2 tsp ground cardamom
    1   Tbsp grated lemon zest

Cover and let rise until puffy, 60-90 minutes.

Knead into dough [see Notes]:
    1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds
    3 cups fruit (2:1 currants:citrus peel)

Divide dough into three pieces.

Shape each into 6"x8" oval.  Place a 1/4 cup marzipan log
[Note: almond paste--less sweet] down the longer center of
each oval (3/4 cup total).  Fold dough over, sort of in
thirds (like you do in bread).  Pinch the seam and form a
loaf.

Let rise (again) for 45-60 minutes until puffy.

Preheat oven to 350.

Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes, internal temperature 190F.
[note: closer to 45 minutes--doneness is challenging with
the almond paste][Most recent attempt was a little dry and
baked a bit long.]

Remove from oven, brush with melted butter.  After 5
minutes, dust with glazing sugar.

[Notes: OMG, beautiful!]
[Notes: 1/2 tsp (freshly) ground nutmeg (not mace)]
[Notes: Use almond paste, not marzipan;  KAF 10oz container
        had enough left for perhaps another log.  My logs
        were a generous 1/4 cup]
[Notes: Kneading in the fruit will seem untenable--the dough
        will shed fruit--just keep going and keep it
        together.  It will eventually settle down.]
