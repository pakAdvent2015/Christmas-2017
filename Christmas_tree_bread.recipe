I do not know the origin of this recipe--I suspect gourmet in the
early 70s.  I cannot remember a Christmas without this.  Rosemary thinks
more likely Sunset (and has some good evidence to support this).  There
is a revision from the original that we cannot find.


(1) Heat gently until butter melts and then let cool
       1/3 cup milk
           [5 1/3 tsp milk powder]
           [in enough water      ]
       1/3 cup butter
       1/4 sugar
       1/2 t salt

(2) Proof
       1 T yeast
       1/4 C warm water

Add (1) to (2).

Add and mix:
       3/2 cup flour

Beat:
       2 eggs
       3/2 t cardamom

Add egg mixture and stir in:
       3/2 cup flour

KNEAD AND LET RISE!  (45 to 90 minutes here)

Shape into 15" square and cut
       25 2.75" circles
       1 star  
       [We used 2.5" OD and 1.25~ ID, 7th and 2nd from center, or 5th
       from the outside and 2nd from the center.] 

Take remaining dough and shape into an isosceles triangle:
       12" base
       14" height

Arrange circles and star (from top to bottom)
       star-2-3-4-5-5-6
       [note the deliberate repeat of 5]

LET RISE!  (45 to 90 minutes here)

Cook at 350 for 15 minutes (I think that we generally need to have this
go longer)

glaze with 1/4 cup apricot jam
(mix jam with some water, warm in the microwave)

Fill with red currant jelly (if you can treat it to congeal...
Otherwise, just spoonfuls of jam are just lovely!)
