Gravlax - Norwegian cured salmon

2.5 - 3 lb salmon fillet, skin on, all bones removed
1.5 Tbsp + salt
2.25 tsp sugar
4 Tbsp + cognac
~1 C packed fresh dill sprigs

Trim salmon & cut into two equal-area halves; save thin end of tail
for salmon tartare.

Mix sugar, salt; sprinkle over each fillet & rub in.  Drizzle cognac
over fillet, rub in.  Put one half in glass dish, distribut dill, & put
the other half on top (skin up) like a salmon dill sammich.

Cover w/ cling film and put a weight on top of salmon.  Put it in
the fridge.  Each day, flip salmon, baste w/ extruded juices, &
re-weight.  Add more salt & cognac as needed.  Cure 4 days.

To serve slice gravlax thin & on shallow angle, like flank-steak,
not through the skin.  Use skin flap to cover unserved portion.
Good w/ dark bread.

Keeps ~1wk.

Gravlax, recipe as done for Basque:

2.25 lbs salmon, in two filets
4 Tbsp salt
4 Tbsp sugar
4 tsp white pepper
many sprigs of dill (don't chop)

Mix salt/sugar/pepper.  Coat salmon with ground spices (rub it in), make
a sandwich of salmon & dill (skin side out), weight, and let cure 3
days.

Gravlax sauce -

1.5 Tbsp white wine vinegar
1.75 Tbsp sugar
1/2 C olive oil
5-6 Tbsp dijon mustard
1+ Tbsp fresh dill
1 Tbsp white pepper

Blend.

Notes[2013-03-09]:
    Made for basque as above (i.e., no cognac).  The sauce was probably
    spectacular with the Maile Dijon mustard (very salty, used only 5T
    or so of mustard).
