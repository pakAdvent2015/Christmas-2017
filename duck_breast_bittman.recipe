http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/dining/241mrex.html

Oven  at 400F

[For one breast]
1-2 garlic
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 tsp rosemary
2 Tbsp parm
olive oil

slit skin like bread
5 minutes skin side down in medium pan
10 minutes in oven

5-10 minutes to rest.



2 boneless duck breast halves
 => make "pocket" by slicing in
    from center of one edge

2 to 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 teaspoons fennel seeds, crushed
2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
    (we half grated, and half-ish as shavings)
Olive oil
  => mash to paste (mini cuise)
     stuff into duck "pocket"

Oven to 400F

Season outside of duck w. S&P.

Slit skin like you were making bread!

UPDATED cooking directions:

    Skillet on medium-high/high

    Make sure you slit the skin...

    Duck in, skin side down (maybe open windows, use splash guard)

    FIVE MINUTES ON THE SKIN SIDE ONLY

    Flip, put in oven

    TEN MINUTES in the oven

    [125F is supposed to be cooked...., but it came out _BEAUTIFULLY_
    just on the time alone--1 pound breast]

    Out, rest for 5-10 minutes, carve, eat.

Try not to eat it all at once.
